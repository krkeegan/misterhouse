        <p>Many many people have contributed to MisterHouse in various ways over
        the years.  Unfortunately, it is impossible to identify everyone and 
        their contributions.  However we greatly appreciate any contribution in
        any form.  The following link identifies those who contributed code to 
        either the old SVN repository or the new GIT repository under their own
        name.
        </p>
