<p>MisterHouse is an open source home automation program.
It's fun, it's free, and it's entirely geeky.
Written in <a target='other' href=http://www.perl.com>Perl</a>, it fires events based on time,
web, socket, voice, and serial data.
It currently runs on Windows 95 or newer and on most Unix based platforms, including Linux and Mac OSX.

<p>Perl subroutines and objects are used to give a powerful
programming interface.  Here is some example code:

<pre>
   $fountain = new X10_Item 'B1';
   set $fountain ON if time_now '6:00 PM';

   $movement_sensor = new Serial_Item 'XA2', 'stair';
   play(file => 'stairs_creek*.wav') if state_now $movement_sensor eq 'stair';

   $v_bedroom_curtain = new Voice_Cmd '[open,close] the bedroom curtains';
   curtain('bedroom', $state) if $state = said $v_bedroom_curtain;
</pre>
